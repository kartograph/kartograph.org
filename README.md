# kartograph.org

This is the source of the website running at http://kartograph.org.

This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) website, so you have to 
[install](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Install/) and
run Jekyll in the root directory. 

It will generate a folder "_site" which contains the fully rendered website.
Make this your document root and it should look fine.

You can also run it without a webserver by running `jekyll --server`
from the root directory and going to
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
