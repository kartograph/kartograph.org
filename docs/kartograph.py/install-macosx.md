# Installing Kartograph.py on Mac OS X

Before installing Kartograph, please install the GDAL Complete Framework as provided by William Kyngesburye on kyngchaos.com: [http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks). 

I recommend to install Kartograph in its own [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/). Otherwise you need to ``sudo`` every **pip** call.
    
### Install required Python packages

Kartograph.py needs a couple of Python packages. You can install them all at once using:

    pip install -r https://raw.github.com/kartograph/kartograph.py/master/requirements.txt
    
### Alternative way if GDAL install fails
    
Some users reported that the install of the [GDAL](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/1.9.1) package fails on OSX. The way around this issue is to use the pre-compiled package included in GDAL Complete Framework, which you already installed.

You need to include their location in your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable. This can be done either in the ``activate`` script of your virtualenv or in your favorite shell startup file (``.bashrc``, ``.profile``, etc.).

    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Versions/1.9/Python/2.7/site-packages

Then use [requirements-nogdal.txt](https://raw.github.com/kartograph/kartograph.py/master/requirements-nogdal.txt) to install all required packages except ``GDAL``.

    pip install -r https://raw.github.com/kartograph/kartograph.py/master/requirements-nogdal.txt

### Install Kartograph.py
    
Then you should be ready to install Kartograph using:
    
    pip install https://github.com/kartograph/kartograph.py/zipball/master


# Test Installation

Download the 1:50m Admin 0 Countries shapefile from Natural Earth into a newly created folder "kartograph-test" in your home folder.

    mkdir ~/kartograph-test
    cd ~/kartograph-test;
    wget http://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/50m/cultural/ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip
    unzip ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip


Create a very basic map configuration by creating a new text file named "world.json" and paste the following content into it:

    {
       "layers": [{
           "src": "ne_50m_admin_0_countries.shp"
       }],
        "bounds": {
            "mode": "bbox",
            "data": [-10, 40, 20, 60],
            "padding": 1
        }
    }


Then you create the map using the following command:


    kartograph world.json -o world.svg


Congrats, that's it. Here's what you should see now.

There are more tests included in the Kartograph.py repository on Github.

# Troubleshooting

* Speaking about shapely, this [installation guide](http://tumblr.pauladamsmith.com/post/17663153373/howtoinstallgdalshapely) might help you getting it running on Mac OS.
* During the install Python will need to compile packages, make sure that you have a working compiler on your system. Installing XCode with the Command line Utils helps.
