        <h1>Why Kartograph?</h1>
        <p>Kartograph is a new framework for building interactive map applications without Google Maps or any other mapping service. It was created with the needs of <a href="/showcase/italia/">designers</a> and <a href="/showcase/charts/">data journalists</a> in mind.</p>

        <p>Please check out the <a href="/showcase/">showcase section</a> to see what Kartograph can do for you or dive into the <a href="/about/">details on how it works</a>.</p>

        <h2>Current Progress</h2>
        <p>At the moment Kartograph is still in an early pre-release state, which means that it basically works and is already used a lot by its author but there are some more things left to do to make it as easy-to-use for everybody else. This includes tutorials and step-by-step examples and API documentation.</p>
        <p>If you like Kartograph and can’t wait to support its development, please find the donation buttons on the left. Any contribution is much appreciated. Thanks!</p>

            <li>Runs 100% stand-alone</li>
            <li>Gracefully degrades to IE7</li>

        <!--<h2>Out of scope</h2>
        <p>Sorry, but the one thing Kartograph can’t do for you is tile maps. So, if you really, really need street-level details in your map, try one of the <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com">other</a> <a href="http://polymaps.org">great</a> <a href="http://openlayers.org">mapping</a> <a href="http://developers.cartodb.com/">frameworks</a>.</p>-->
